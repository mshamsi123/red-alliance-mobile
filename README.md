# Overview
The Red Alliance mobile application is written in JavaScript with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). 

The app allows scouters for FRC teams to collect data about competiting FRC teams. This app is the primary source of data for TRA API and TRA analysis. It features a JSON-configurable scouting GUI for easy customization with match and pit scouting functionality.  

# Build/Run for Development

## Android
**Requirements**
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/) 
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)
  - You may also use OpenJDK or similar Java implementations

### Setup 
1. Make sure that the `emulator`, `adb`, `yarn`, and `android-studio` executables are in your PATH folders.
  - The `emulator` executable does not need to be present if you are testing on a physical device. If you are, ensure that it is plugged in to your computer and that [ADB debugging mode is enabled](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#Enabling).
2. Ensure that all dependencies are installed by running `yarn`.
### Running the app
3. In one terminal window, run `yarn start` to start the code server.
4. In another terminal window, run `yarn run android` to compile the development version of the app and install it on the emulator/physical device.

## iOS
**Requirements**
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)
### Setup
1. Make sure that the CocoaPods executable `pod` are in your PATH folders.
2. Ensure that all dependencies are installed by running `yarn`.
3. Navigate to the `ios` folder and run `pod install`.
### Running the app
4. In Xcode, open the Xcode **workspace** file `ios/RedAlliance.xcworkspace`. 
5. Click the play button in the toolbar.

# Build Production Releases
These releases bundle all JS assets with the app, minify all code, and create an Android App Bundle (AAB) file. This file can then be uploaded to the Google Play developer console for release to the public. 

## Android
1. Navigate to the `android` folder. 
2. In a terminal window, execute `./gradlew assembleRelease`.

## iOS
Building iOS releases is not supported at this time.
